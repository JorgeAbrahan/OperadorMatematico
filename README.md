This math operator built in C++ has the listed basic functionalities:
 - add n amount of numbers
 - add until n number
 - subtract n numbers
 - multiply n numbers
 - decompose a number into it's prime factors
 - number to a power
 - find parity of a number
 - know the multiplication table of n number
 - find out if any number in a set is the sum of the others
 - find the factorial of n number

intermediate level operations such as:
 - solve a quadratic equation
 - apply the pythagorean theorem
 - calculate the length of a vector

Matrix operations:
 - add matrices
 - subtract matrices
 - multiply matrices
 - know the principal diagonal on a matrix
 - know the transpose of a matrix

Conversions between number systems:
 - from decimal to roman
 - from decimal to binary
 - from decimal to hexadecimal

and a game that consists of guessing a random number generated by the computer.

The main goal of the program is to implement the diferent math operators on C++, and also familiarize with the use of functions, libraries, loops and other basic pillars of programming.
